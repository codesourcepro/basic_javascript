JavaScript variables are powerful programming constructs. However, there is a convention that should be 
followed by creating a variable in JavaScript.

Following are the rules that a Developer should follow to properly get variables declared:
- Variable name should only contain alphabets, numbers, $ and _
- Variable name should not start with a number
- Variable names are case-sensitive i.e. result and Result are two different variables
- Variables can’t be named as one of the reserved keywords like let, return, const, etc.
- Variable should use camelCase i.e. numOne is preferred over NumOne or numone
- Variable can’t have hyphen - in its name
- Use easy-to-understand names that symbolize the value stored in variables. 
    For e.g. instead of calling a variable phNum, a Developer can call it phoneNumber.
- Don’t use single-letter variable names like x, a, z, etc.
