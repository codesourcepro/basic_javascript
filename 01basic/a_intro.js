1.What is Javascript?
=> JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages.
    It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document. 
    It was introduced in the year 1995 for adding programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser. Since then, it has been adopted 
    by all other graphical web browsers. With JavaScript, users can build modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the page 
    every time. The traditional website uses js to provide several forms of interactivity and simplicity.

    Features of JavaScript
    => There are following features of JavaScript:
        - All popular web browsers support JavaScript as they provide built-in execution environments.
        - JavaScript follows the syntax and structure of the C programming language. Thus, it is a structured programming language.
        - JavaScript is a weakly typed language, where certain types are implicitly cast (depending on the operation).
        - JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that uses prototypes rather than using classes for inheritance.
        - It is a light-weighted and interpreted language.
        - It is a case-sensitive language.
        - JavaScript is supportable in several operating systems including, Windows, macOS, Linux etc.
        - It provides good control to the users over the web browsers.

    History of JavaScript
    => In 1993, Mosaic, the first popular web browser, came into existence. In the year 1994, Netscape was founded by Marc Andreessen. 
        He realized that the web needed to become more dynamic. Thus, a 'glue language' was believed to be provided to HTML to make web designing 
        easy for designers and part-time programmers. Consequently, in 1995, the company recruited Brendan Eich intending to implement and embed Scheme 
        programming language to the browser. But, before Brendan could start, the company merged with Sun Microsystems for adding Java into its Navigator 
        so that it could compete with Microsoft over the web technologies and platforms. Now, two languages were there: Java and the scripting language. 
        Further, Netscape decided to give a similar name to the scripting language as Java's. It led to 'Javascript'. Finally, in May 1995, Marc Andreessen 
        coined the first code of Javascript named 'Mocha'. Later, the marketing team replaced the name with 'LiveScript'. But, due to trademark reasons and 
        certain other reasons, in December 1995, the language was finally renamed to 'JavaScript'. From then, JavaScript came into existence.

Lexical Structure
=> The lexical structure of a programming language is the set of elementary rules 
    that specifies how you write programs in that language. 
    
    It is the lowest-level syntax of a language; it specifies such things as what 
    variable names look like, the delimiter characters for comments, and how one 
    program statement is separated from the next.

    1. Character Set
    => A character set is the key component behind displaying, manipulating and editing text, numbers and 
        symbols on a computer.A character set is created through a process known as encoding i.e. each 
        character is assigned with a unique code or value.

    => JavaScript programs are written using the Unicode character set. Unicode is a superset of ASCII 
        and Latin-1 and supports virtually every written language currently used on the planet. 
        ECMAScript 3 requires JavaScript implementations to support Unicode version 2.1 or later, and 
        ECMAScript 5 requires implementations to support Unicode 3 or later. See the sidebar in Text for more 
        about Unicode and JavaScript.

    => All word and/or data processing applications are embedded with one or more character sets.
        The characters within a character set can be text, number or even symbols. Each character is 
        represented by a number. ASCII characters set is one of the most popular character sets used by 
        general computers to display text or numbers on computer screen. It represents uppercase and lower 
        case English alphabets, number, mathematical operators and symbols from number 0–127.

    2. Identifier
    - An identifier is a sequence of characters in the code that identifies a variable, function, or property.
        In JavaScript, identifiers are case-sensitive and can contain Unicode letters, $, _, and digits (0-9),
        but may not start with a digit.
    
    - An identifier differs from a string in that a string is data, while an identifier is part of the code. 
        In JavaScript, there is no way to convert identifiers to strings, but sometimes it is possible to parse 
        strings into identifiers.

    5. Commments
        - A JavaScript comment is a powerful programming construct to explain complex code blocks, what they 
        do, and why they were implemented in a particular way. As systems and websites evolve, Developers 
        always end up writing code that is complex. Code written this way might make complete sense to the 
        original author or Developer, but might not be obvious to a Developer new to the team looking at the
         code for the very first time, or even to the author’s future self. In such cases, comments are a 
         very powerful tool to explain the thought process and decisions made while writing a block of code.
         
        a) JavaScript Single-Line Comment
        - Single line comments are very useful to add a quick comment or explanation over a line of code. 
        In JavaScript, a single line comment can be added by using two forward slashes //. 
        Below are some examples of single-line comments in JavaScript code.

        // print hello world
        console.log("hello world")

        b) JavaScript Multi-Line Comment
        - Sometimes, a single line is not enough to document or explain why certain code is written in a 
        particular way or what it does. This is when a JavaScript Developer will opt for writing comments 
        across multiple lines (a JavaScript multi-line comment can also be referred to as block comments).
        
        Multi-line comments in JavaScript code can be added by writing the comment between a forward-slash 
        followed by asterisk / * and asterisk followed by a forward-slash * /. Below are some examples of 
        multi-line comments.
